    ############# Application #6 - Basic Network Sniffer #############
    
#In Scapy, we will use the sniff() function to capture network packets.
#To see a list of what commands Scapy has available, run the lsc() function.
#Run the ls() command to see ALL the supported protocols.
#Run the ls(protocol) command to see the fields and default values for any protocol.
#See packet layers with the .summary() function.
#See packet contents with the .show() function.
#Dig into a specific packet layer using a list index: pkts[3][2].summary()...
#...the first index chooses the packet out of the pkts list, the second index chooses the layer for that specific packet.
#Using the .command() packet method will return a string of the command necessary to recreate that sniffed packet.

#To see the list of optional arguments for the sniff() function:

Sniff packets
sniff([count=0,] [prn=None,] [store=1,] [offline=None,] [lfilter=None,] + L2ListenSocket args) -> list of packets

  count: number of packets to capture. 0 means infinity
  store: wether to store sniffed packets or discard them
    prn: function to apply to each packet. If something is returned,
         it is displayed. Ex:
         ex: prn = lambda x: x.summary()
lfilter: python function applied to each packet to determine
         if further action may be done
         ex: lfilter = lambda x: x.haslayer(Padding)
offline: pcap file to read packets from, instead of sniffing them
timeout: stop sniffing after a given time (default: None)
L2socket: use the provided L2socket
opened_socket: provide an object ready to use .recv() on
stop_filter: python function applied to each packet to determine
             if we have to stop the capture after this packet
             ex: stop_filter = lambda x: x.haslayer(TCP)

#Setting network interface in promiscuous mode
#Wikipedia: In computer networking, promiscuous mode or "promisc mode"[1] is a mode for a wired network interface controller (NIC) or wireless network interface controller (WNIC)...
#...that causes the controller to pass all traffic it receives to the central processing unit (CPU) rather than passing only the frames that the controller is intended to receive.
#This mode is normally used for packet sniffing that takes place on a router or on a computer connected to a hub.

#Also, when using our setup (VirtualBox-to-GNS3), you should go to the Settings section for the virtual machine you are using...
#...select the adapter that connects to the GNS3 network and set Promiscuous Mode: Allow All
